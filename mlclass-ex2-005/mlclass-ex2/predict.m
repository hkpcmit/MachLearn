function p = predict(theta, X)
%PREDICT Predict whether the label is 0 or 1 using learned logistic 
%regression parameters theta
%   p = PREDICT(theta, X) computes the predictions for X using a 
%   threshold at 0.5 (i.e., if sigmoid(theta'*x) >= 0.5, predict 1)

m = size(X, 1); % Number of training examples

% You need to return the following variables correctly
p = zeros(m, 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
%               your learned logistic regression parameters. 
%               You should set p to a vector of 0's and 1's
%
delta = sigmoid(X*theta) - 0.4999;
% Add a new column of zeros and compute max along rows.  Then use ceil()
% to predict numbers of 1.  
delta = [delta zeros(m,1)];
p = ceil(max(delta, [], 2));
